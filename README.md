# Timothy-Wong-MSc-DS-Project
When we think about human values, we think of what is important to us in life. However, value preferences are also context specific. This project aims at creating a complete pipeline to convert context related corpus to a context-specific value list, and training its classifier, so that the context-specific values can be extracted for concrete use.
