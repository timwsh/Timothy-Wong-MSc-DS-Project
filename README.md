# Timothy-Wong-MSc-DS-Project
Human values are broad motivational goals --- when we think about values, we think of what is important to us in life. We find an argument from others as persuasive or not based on whether or not that argument promotes the values we prefer. For example, a person preferring the value of freedom may find the argument ``loneliness and isolation are a bigger killer than corona'' persuasive in favour of lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Value preferences, however, are context specific. A person with a preference for freedom over safety in Covid-19 context may prefer safety over freedom in another context. This project seeks to create a highly computerised method to identify context-specific values in arguments.

This github repository consists of all the data, models and python code to recreate my MSc Data Science project for "Identifying Context-Specific Values in Arguments". This project heavily relys on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models, which is a Neural Networks Model, to identify human values under text documents.
